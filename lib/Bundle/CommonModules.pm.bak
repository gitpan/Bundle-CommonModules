=head1 NAME

Bundle::CommonModules - Perl extension for assisting automatic installation of common Perl modules.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bundle::CommonModules;
  

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module does nothing, so doing a 'use' is silly.  This module is intended to be useful as a way
to automatically install a variety of common Perl modules that are not in the core distribution, but
may or may not be useful in the wide world of real-world script writing.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.

=head1 SEE ALSO

There is a module named Bundle::Everything which includes all CPAN modules.  however, it is 
not useful because it fails the first time you do not have a library that some module requires.

This bundle will require no libraries for installatino and do everything it can to keep going 
after any failure, so at least you get some modules installed.

There is no mailing list for this module.  If you have a suggestion for a module to be included,
send an email or post an enhancement request / bug report for this module in the http://rt.cpan.org site.
